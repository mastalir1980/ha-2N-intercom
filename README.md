## 2N API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose | Platform |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `/api/call/status` | Monitor doorbell rings and call state | binary_sensor |
| `/api/dir/query` | Get caller directory information | binary_sensor |
| `/api/switch/ctrl` | Control relays (open door/gate) | switch, cover |
| `/api/camera/snapshot` | Get JPEG snapshot | camera |
| RTSP stream | Live video streaming | camera |

## HomeKit Integration

### Setup

1. Ensure Home Assistant HomeKit Bridge is configured
2. Add the 2N Intercom integration
3. Link the doorbell sensor to the camera (YAML only)

```yaml
homekit:
  - name: 2N Intercom Doorbell
    port: 21065
    filter:
      include_entities:
        - camera.2n_intercom_camera
    entity_config:
      camera.2n_intercom_camera:
        linked_doorbell_sensor: binary_sensor.2n_intercom_doorbell
```

Notes:
- Do not include `binary_sensor.*_doorbell` in the filter.
- Do not include the camera or doorbell in any other HomeKit bridge.
- After YAML change, restart HA and re-add the HomeKit bridge in the Home app.

### Accessory Types

- **Camera** → Video Doorbell (if doorbell enabled)
- **Binary Sensor** → Linked to camera via `linked_doorbell_sensor`
- **Switch (Door)** → Switch or Lock accessory
- **Cover (Gate)** → Garage Door Opener accessory

### Siri Commands

**Camera:**
- "Show me the front door camera"
- "What does the camera see?"

**Doorbell:**
- Ring events appear as HomeKit notifications

**Door (Switch):**
- "Turn on the front door" (triggers relay)
- "Open the front door"

**Gate (Cover):**
- "Open the driveway gate"
- "Close the driveway gate"
- "Is the gate open?"

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect Error

**Symptoms:** "Failed to connect to the device" during setup

**Solutions:**
1. Verify IP address and port are correct
2. Check network connectivity to intercom
3. Verify username and password
4. Try HTTP instead of HTTPS if SSL verification fails
5. Check firewall rules

### Camera Not Streaming

**Symptoms:** Camera entity exists but no video

**Solutions:**
1. Verify RTSP stream is enabled on 2N intercom
2. Test RTSP URL manually: `rtsp://username:password@ip:554/h264_stream`
3. Check Home Assistant logs for stream errors

### Doorbell Not Triggering

**Symptoms:** Binary sensor not changing to "on" when doorbell rings

**Solutions:**
1. Verify doorbell is enabled in configuration
2. Check coordinator polling interval (default: 5 seconds)
3. Verify `/api/call/status` returns "ringing" state during ring
4. Check Home Assistant logs for API errors

### Relay Not Working

**Symptoms:** Switch/cover doesn't control relay

**Solutions:**
1. Verify relay number is correct (1-4)
2. Check relay is configured and enabled on 2N intercom
3. Test relay via 2N web interface
4. Verify credentials have permission to control relays
5. Check Home Assistant logs for API errors

### HomeKit Not Showing Entities

**Doorbell appears as occupancy sensor:**
1. Remove `binary_sensor.*_doorbell` from HomeKit filter.
2. Link doorbell to camera via `linked_doorbell_sensor` (see setup above).
3. Ensure the camera and doorbell are not present in any other HomeKit bridge.
4. Restart Home Assistant and re-add the HomeKit bridge in the Home app.

**Symptoms:** Entities visible in HA but not in Home app

**Solutions:**
1. Verify HomeKit Bridge is running
2. Check HomeKit Bridge includes the entities
3. Reset HomeKit Bridge and re-pair
4. Check entity is not in "unavailable" state
